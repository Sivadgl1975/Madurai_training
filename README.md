Embeddings are numerical representations of data that help machine-learning models understand and compare different items. These embeddings convert raw data—such as images, text, videos, and audio—into vectors in a high-dimensional space where similar items are placed close to each other. This process simplifies the task of processing complex data, making it easier for ML models to handle tasks like recommendation systems or text analysis.

The mathematical foundation of embeddings relies on the principle that semantic similarity can be captured through geometric proximity in vector space. When two concepts are conceptually related, their corresponding embedding vectors will have a smaller distance between them, typically measured using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. This mathematical relationship enables automated reasoning about content relationships without explicit programming of domain-specific rules.
